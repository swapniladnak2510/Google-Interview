# Google-Interview
### Basic Tips:
- Ask Questions & Seek Clarification
- Pattern Recognition
- Think out loud - Talking through the thought process. It is similar to having a conversation with the Interviewer!
- Time Management - Time yourself to finish the codes for the 2-3 problems asked. Finishing the efficient, bug free, optimized, clean and concise code in the given time is the key.
### Resource 2: Data Structure & Algorithms
- Know your basic and advanced data structures & algorithms well - not just theory but how to practically implement them in your solutions. 
- You should know Big-O really well, along with searching and sorting algorithms, trees, graphs, maps, recursions, BFS /DFS and hash tables to name a few.
### Resource 3: Coding

- For the coding, the most important aspect is how fast and efficient your solution is. Speed of coding is very important
Code should be production ready style
- Look to optimise and debug as much as possible. 
- Code should be readable and maintainable by other people sharing a large codebase.
- We look for clean and concise solutions, and well-structured code with good use of variable and method names. You should know the coding language, constructs and library functions well and make good use of itâ€™s features.


### MOST IMPORTANT: Time your self during the interview while writing code. You will be asked 2-3 problems / puzzles during the interview.





### During the interview: Ask yourself!

- Do you feel confident with CS fundamentals?
- Do you listen well?
- Do you know what to ask to clarify the questions?
- Can you find the optimal solution of the complicated coding/algorithm problems, present it in a very efficient/clean coding (no/less bug), and share your thoughts logically?
- Is your problem solving and coding speedy and efficient with your profound knowledge in CS fundamentals?
Have you covered off edge cases?
